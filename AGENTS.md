# 🤖 AGENTS.md

Welcome, AI Agent! This file contains the essential project context, behavioral constraints, engineering standards, and execution workflows required to develop, maintain, and scale **CivicPulse** safely and efficiently. 

Always read and align your outputs with this specification before proposing or modifying code.

## 📋 1. Project Overview & Scope

CivicPulse is an automated, AI-driven pipeline and predictive dashboard that acts as a **"digital public square"** listener for Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) zones. It ingests unstructured text (RSS feeds, scraped tweets, r/hyderabad posts), processes it using Large Language Models (LLMs) for Named Entity Recognition (NER), resolves landmarks to geographic zones, and mathematically prioritizes grievances using an algorithmic **Predictive Impact Engine**.

* **Target Geography**: Strictly scoped to Hyderabad, Telangana, India across 6 primary GHMC zones (`Central`, `North`, `South`, `West`, `East`, `Secunderabad`).
* **Core Pillars**: Reactive-to-proactive urban governance, data-driven prioritization, and date-aware chronological/traction analysis.

## 🛠️ 2. Environment Setup, Build, & Test Commands

### Environment Requirements
* **Runtime**: Python 3.10+
* **Key Dependencies**: `pandas`, `streamlit`, `crawl4ai`, `langchain`, `geopy`, `Chart.js` (via frontend script injection).

### Core Commands
Execute these exact shell commands within the project root directory when setting up or validating:

```bash
# 1. Dependency Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Start the Frontend Streamlit Dashboard
streamlit run app.py

# 3. Trigger Data Ingestion Pipeline (Mock / Live Scraper Run)
python src/ingestion/pipeline.py

# 4. Run the Test Suite
pytest tests/

```
### 3. Code Style & Technical Guidelines

When writing code or generating components, stick to these implementation patterns:

### Backend (Python)
* **Standard:** Follow PEP 8 strictly. Use clear, typed function definitions:
    ```python
    def calculate_score(S: float, F: float) -> float:
    ```
* **Data Structures:** Use `pandas` DataFrames for managing historical issue tracking, indexing by unique record IDs.
* **Date Formats:** Maintain ISO 8601 formatting (`YYYY-MM-DD`) for all date storage to support structural switching between `post_date` and `traction_date` filtering.

### Frontend UI (Streamlit & Injection)
* **Aesthetic:** Keep layouts clean and highly scannable, prioritizing metrics boxes, simple data tables, and dynamic visual indicators.
* **Color-Coded Urgency:** Always mirror the established visual scoring design language in any UI or component code updates:

| Urgency Level | Score Threshold | Text Color Hex | Background Color Hex |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Critical** | $\ge 8.0$ | `#A32D2D` | `#FCEBEB` |
| **High** | $\ge 7.0$ | `#BA7517` | `#FAEEDA` |
| **Medium** | $\ge 6.0$ | `#1D9E75` | `#E1F5EE` |

## 🧮 4. The Predictive Impact Scoring Logic

If you are modifying the mathematical rating backend, you must not alter the normalized weights of the predictive algorithm without explicit instruction. The scoring formula is deterministic:

$$Impact\ Score = (S \times 0.30) + (F \times 0.25) + (R \times 0.20) + (D \times 0.15) + (P \times 0.10)$$

### Parameter Validation Safeguards
When writing mock tests or calculations, verify these parameter constraints:
* **Severity ($S$, 30%):** Scaled 0–10 based on immediate safety threats.
* **Frequency ($F$, 25%):** Normalized duplicates grouped by spatial proximity.
* **Compounding Risk ($R$, 20%):** Seasonal amplifiers (e.g., Waterlogging + Monsoon season).
* **Issue Duration ($D$, 15%):** Linear aging factors mapped over a 30-day window.
* **Population Density ($P$, 10%):** Static locality lookup matrices based on localized GHMC structural data.

## 🧪 5. Testing Instructions

All code submissions must be validated against real-world Hyderabad geographic coordinates and localized structural realities.

* **Mock Verification Data:** Ensure your unit test suites include checks for well-known Hyderabad areas (e.g., verifying that *"Mehdipatnam flyover"* resolves correctly to the Central zone, or *"Kukatpally metro"* routes to the West zone).
* **Sorting Integration Verification:** Always run assertions to verify that sorting by `traction_date` behaves distinctly from sorting by `post_date` to prevent chronological regressions in high-volume public engagement tracking.

---

## 🔒 6. Security & Operational Considerations

* **API Key Protections:** Never hardcode access credentials for LLM endpoints (Gemini, Groq, Ollama) directly into the code modules. Always interface via system environment files using `os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")`.
* **Scraping Rate-Limits:** Implement exponential backoff schedules and conservative rate-limiting strategies within the `crawl4ai` pipeline workflows to respect local news feeds and social space servers, preventing IP blocking.
* **Geocoding Fallbacks:** If `geopy` or landmark regex extraction fails to correctly resolve an incoming landmark string to an official GHMC zone boundary, catch the exception, apply a `Fallback / Unknown` structural tag, and route the record to a manual administrative triage queue. Do not let missing spatial data crash the live pipeline.

## 🚀 7. Git Commit & Pull Request Rules

### Commit Message Convention
Follow structured prefix formats for clear project tracking:
* `feat/` for new pipeline features (e.g., `feat: added r/hyderabad scraper parser`).
* `fix/` for algorithmic or layout adjustments (e.g., `fix: updated population density parameter lookup scale`).
* `docs/` for modifying configuration guidelines or internal manuals.

### PR Structural Check
Before finalizing a Pull Request, ensure that changes to the core layout do not disturb the main tracking metrics (**Active**, **Critical**, **Zones Affected**, **Resolved**) displayed in the core user interface dashboard view.
